Additional information
<br><pr>
1. Subject of data protection, legal bases and sources
The subject of data protection is personal data. Personal data is all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). Your personal data therefore includes all data that allow your person to be identified, such as your name, address, telephone number or email address. Personal data also includes information that arises from the use of our website, such as the start, end and scope of use or your IP address.
We only process your data if an applicable legal regulation allows it. We will base the processing of your data on the following legal bases, among others: Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 Letter a GDPR): We will only process certain data on the basis of your previously given express and voluntary consent. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time with future effect. Fulfillment of a contract or implementation of pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 Letter b GDPR): In particular to initiate or execute your contract with happyfields.de, we need certain data from you.
Fulfillment of a legal obligation (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 Letter c GDPR): we also have to process your personal data to fulfill legal obligations, such as tax retention periods.
Protection of legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f GDPR): happyfields.de only processes certain data from you so that we can protect your interests or the interests of third parties if your interests do not outweigh the individual case. Please note that this is not a complete or exhaustive list of the possible legal bases, but that these are only examples, but are only examples that are intended to make the legal data protection legal basis more transparent. For more information on the legal basis of the individual data processing on our website, please refer to the comments under the following paragraphs.
This personal data mainly comes from yourself, in particular from your contact requests, bookings and information when the contract is concluded.

The website uses cookies and similar technologies such as HTML5 storage (hereinafter collectively “cookies”) in order to optimize the design of the website. Among other things, this enables easier navigation and improved user friendliness. Cookies are small identifying marks that our web server sends to your browser and that your end device saves with the appropriate standard setting. These can be used to determine whether there has already been communication with your device. As a result, they serve the purpose of keeping the use comfortable and optimizing it. This processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 Letter f GDPR with regard to strictly necessary cookies and on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 Letter a GDPR, if you consent to the storage and use of additional own cookies or third-party cookies. Personal data can then be stored in cookies if this is technically absolutely necessary or you have given your consent. If you use our website, you can give us your consent to the use and storage of additional own cookies or third-party cookies on your device. You can revoke your consent to the use and storage of cookies at any time with future effect by deactivating the respective cookie settings of this website described below with regard to additional own cookies or third-party cookies.

4. Establishing contact
Whichever way you choose to contact us: Your data, which you voluntarily provide to us, will only be used for the intended purpose. We delete the data provided by you as soon as the purpose of the collection ceases to exist, subject to the fulfillment of ongoing legal storage obligations.

5. Comments and posts
Radio-all-africa.org also offers users the opportunity to leave posts or comments at some point. In this case, the IP addresses and other voluntarily provided personal data are stored in order to ensure the possibility of traceability and, if necessary, criminal prosecution or civil law steps in the event of illegal content.
<br>
6. Newsletter
We use the so-called double opt-in procedure for sending the newsletter, i.e. we will only send you a newsletter by email if you have expressly confirmed to us beforehand that we should activate the newsletter service. As with most other providers, you will receive a confirmation email that ensures that you really want the newsletter and that the specified mailbox is the right one. Only when you agree there will you receive the www.radio-all-africa.org newsletter. This consent can be withdrawn at any time without giving reasons. If you withdraw your consent, all personal data will also be deleted, unless they are affected by statutory retention requirements.
<br>
7. Facebook
Our website also contains references (links) to the external social network Facebook. This website is operated exclusively by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (Facebook). The references are identified on our website by the Facebook logo or the addition “Like” (no Facebook plug-ins are used). If these references are followed by a click, the Facebook plugins are activated and your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. If you follow the references while visiting our website and are logged into Facebook via your personal user account, the information that you have visited our website will be forwarded to Facebook. Facebook can associate your visit to the website with your account. This information is transmitted to Facebook and stored there. To prevent this, you must log out of your Facebook account before clicking on the link. The functions assigned to the references from Facebook, in particular the transmission of information and user data, are not already active when you visit our website, but only when you click on the corresponding references. For the purpose and scope of data collection by Facebook and the further processing and use of your data there, as well as your rights and setting options for protecting your privacy, please refer to Facebook’s data protection information ( http://de-de.facebook.com/privacy/explanation .php).

8. Google Analytics
If you have consented to the use and storage of third-party cookies, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 Letter a GDPR, since the data processing is based on your consent. Google is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement and thereby offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law. On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to create reports on activities on the page and to provide us with other services related to website and internet use. We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union (EU) or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA). The full IP address will only be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there in exceptional cases. The IP address transmitted by your browser will not be merged with other Google data. The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for further evaluations
<br>

External recipients may be: Ethics bank in the processing of payments, authorities such as the tax office, courts, legal bodies, (legal basis for such a transfer is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 GDPR), or not public bodies such as service providers and auxiliary persons to whom data are transmitted on the basis of a legal obligation or to protect legitimate interests, such as tax advisors or auditors. The transmission then takes place on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 Letter c and / or f GDPR
<br>
10. Storage period and deletion
We only store your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes or – in the case of consent – as long as you do not withdraw your consent. In the event of an objection, we will no longer process your personal data unless their further processing is permitted or even mandatory according to the relevant legal provisions (e.g. within the scope of commercial and tax law retention requirements). We also delete your personal data if we are not obliged to do so for legal reasons.
